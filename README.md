# VAJRA
Vigilance And Jurisdiction Real-time Analysis 

## Description:
VAJRA is a powerful Flutter-based application designed to enhance law enforcement monitoring and supervision. The application focuses on two main functionalities: dynamic duty monitoring using polyline tracing and static duty monitoring via geofencing on Google Maps. In addition to these core features, VAJRA also includes an alarm notification system that promptly alerts supervisors whenever a police officer violates geofence boundaries or deviates from assigned patrol routes.

## Key Features:

    Dynamic Duty Monitoring: VAJRA employs polyline tracing to track police officers' movements during their dynamic duties. This helps supervisors visualize officers' routes and ensure they follow designated paths effectively.

    Static Duty Monitoring: Geofencing technology is utilized to establish predefined static duty areas on the map. If a police officer enters or exits these areas, VAJRA triggers instant notifications for supervisors to take necessary actions.

    Real-time Alerts: The alarm notification system guarantees that supervisors are immediately informed whenever a police officer violates geofence boundaries or strays from the assigned patrol routes. This enables quick responses and better management of law enforcement operations.

    User-friendly Interface: VAJRA boasts an intuitive user interface that makes it easy for both police officers and supervisors to access and comprehend the information presented. The map-centric design enhances situational awareness and simplifies decision-making.

    Customization: The application allows administrators to define specific patrol routes, geofence areas, and notification triggers according to the unique requirements of each law enforcement operation.

## Why VAJRA?

    Efficiency: VAJRA streamlines law enforcement monitoring processes, optimizing resource allocation and improving overall operational efficiency.

    Accountability: By providing accurate tracking and monitoring, VAJRA holds police officers accountable for adhering to their assigned duties and routes.

    Safety: The real-time alert system contributes to officer safety by enabling swift intervention in case of emergencies or unauthorized actions.

    Data-Driven Insights: The data collected by VAJRA can be analyzed to identify patterns, trends, and areas for improvement in law enforcement practices.

## Future Enhancements:

    Integration with additional map services for broader coverage and accuracy.
    Enhanced reporting and analytics features for comprehensive performance assessment.
    Integration with wearable devices for real-time officer health and safety monitoring.
